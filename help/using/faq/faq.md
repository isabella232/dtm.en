DTM is also fully compatible with responsive designs or mobile-optimized sites consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p> <p>For fully-native, compiled, Objective-C mobile applications where every piece of screen content comes from within the compiled code, there is no tag management system available today to adequately deal with tagging use cases in those environments. For those cases, Adobe recommends the full power, flexibility, and visitor context available through the Analytics SDK. </p> <p>If the apps are a hybrid of native code for their screen "shells" (header, footer, &amp; sidebar) and the native app pulls in HTML and CSS content from the web to display on the mobile device screen, DTM can be useful for the web content. </p> <p>In other words, the tag management functionality you can use in a mobile application depends on how the app was built. </p> </td>

   <td colname="col1"> <p> Will dynamic tag management reduce my website's performance? </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Dynamic tag management has never shown signs of negatively affecting page load time or execution speed. </p> <p>However, because dynamic tag management can be used as a delivery system (a way to deliver JavaScript, HTML, images, or other Web content), if you load a large file, or a large image at the wrong point during render time, you can slow down page load speed and increase code execution time on that page. If you lazy load images, and if you use asynchronous (non-sequential) scripts as much as possible, and you follow best practices regarding the code you add into dynamic tag management, you should not see negative performance impacts. </p> <p> The <a href="../deployment/deployment.md#concept_3F6A0A508F294FCBABEBA1DF540B781B" format="dita" scope="local"> Embed code</a> should be hard-coded in the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> section of your templates. This is a synchronous JavaScript include. The dynamic tag management engine is designed to work in a modular way, so scripts that do not apply to a particular page, site section, or domain will not load or execute when they are not needed. Most users increase the use of asynchronous (non-sequential) methods when deploying third-party scripts. This generally improves the perceived page load speed for site visitors. While the dynamic tag management main library file itself is loaded synchronously, most clients load any code from within dynamic tag management using the built-in asynchronous methods. </p> </td>

Later, when you are looking for all the rules with a certain tag, you can filter the list of rules by Tag Name to find all rules containing that tag. </p> <p>Finally, each rule can be labeled with a Category and a value. The Category is also available when filtering your list of rules, so you can easily and quickly find the list of rules in a certain Category. For example, using a Category like “3rd Party” with a value of “DoubleClick” lets you search for all rules in the “3rd Party” Category, or all rules with the value of “DoubleClick”. </p> </td>

When you choose one of these self-hosted options for the library, each time you make changes in dynamic tag management, those changes are written out by the system to the library files. Those files are typically then "pushed" or "pulled" to your architecture automatically. Once the updated library code is on your servers, you can add the files to your version control systems and processes however you like. If you use GitHub, SVN, or some other system to manage your web development code or content, that works fine with dynamic tag management. </p> <p>One note on version control: Ensure you do not overwrite the production version of the <a href="../deployment/deployment.md#concept_496A6901D970434784182E09B285874B" format="dita" scope="local"> Embed code</a> with the staging version of the Embed code when you commit and push code to production.
