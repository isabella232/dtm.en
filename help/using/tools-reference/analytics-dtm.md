# Adobe Analytics tool{#adobe-analytics-tool}

You can deploy Adobe Analytics (Standard and Premium) using Dynamic Tag Management by creating the Adobe Analytics tool and configuring the page code either automatically or manually. The automatic method is recommended for most users.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For improved visitor tracking, it is strongly recommended that you enable [Experience Cloud ID Service](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html).

## Add an Adobe Analytics tool {#section_D5066B21581B4F7F811AD0027BF44EA5}

1. Click  *&lt;Web Property Name&gt;* > **[!UICONTROL Overview]** > **[!UICONTROL Add a Tool]** > **[!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics]** .

   ![Step Result](assets/add_analytics_tool.png)

1. Fill in the fields:

    * Tool Type

      The type of tool, such as [!DNL Adobe Analytics].
    * Tool Name

      A descriptive name for this tool. This name displays on the [!UICONTROL Overview] tab under [!UICONTROL Installed Tools].
    * Configuration Method

      **Automatic** (Recommended): Use Dynamic Tag Management to manage the configuration. This method enables automatic synchronization of [!DNL Adobe Analytics] report suites via an [!DNL Experience Cloud] login or Web Services ID, and manages the AppMeasurement code.

      After the accounts are connected, Dynamic Tag Management pulls the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] report suite IDs and names into the tool configuration interface, allowing for increased speed in tool deployment with less possibility for user errors.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >You must choose the [!UICONTROL Automatic] option if you are an [!DNL Adobe Analytics Premium] customer. See [Enabling Adobe Analytics Premium](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#section_AEAA44566B5A46D2922E17A11D7EA217) below.

      Fill in the fields specific to automatic configuration:

        * **Experience Cloud**: (Default) Uses [!DNL Experience Cloud] single sign-on. Specify your Experience Cloud ID and password.
        * **Web Services**: Specify your Web Services username and shared secret.

          Shared secret credentials are located in **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Company Settings]** > [Web Services](https://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/reference/web_services_admin.html).

          Developers, see [Get Web Service Access to the Enterprise API](https://www.adobe.io) for help with obtaining Web Services credentials.

      **Manual**: Manually manage the AppMeasurement code. You can download the [!DNL Analytics] [!DNL AppMeasurement] code from  **[!UICONTROL Admin Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Code Manager]** .

      Click [JavaScript (new)](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/js/migrate-from-hcode.html) for information about downloading the code locally to copy and paste in the [!UICONTROL Edit Code] field in [Library Management](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#concept_24654766343B4E82A9416A112D2125FE).

      Fill in the fields specific to a manual configuration:

        * **Production Account ID:** (Required) Your production account for data collection. For Analytics, this is your report suite ID. Dynamic Tag Management automatically installs the correct account in the production and staging environment.
        * **Staging Account ID:** (Required) Used in your development or test environment. For Analytics, this is your report suite ID. A staging account keeps your testing data separate from production.
        * **Tracking Server:** Specify the information for your tracking server.

          The [!UICONTROL Tracking Server] and [!UICONTROL SSL Tracking Server] variables are used for first-party cookie implementation to specify the domain at which the image request and cookie is written. For more information, see the [Correctly Populate the trackingServer and trackingServerSecure Variable](https://helpx.adobe.com/analytics/kb/determining-data-center.html) article.

        * **SSL Tracking Server:** Specify the information for your SSL tracking server.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create Tool]** to create the tool and display it for editing.

   Tools are displayed on the [!UICONTROL Overview] tab, under [!UICONTROL Installed Tools].

1. (Conditional) Configure the tool further as necessary by following the directions in the links below ( [!UICONTROL General], [!UICONTROL Library Management], [!UICONTROL Global Variables], [!UICONTROL Pageviews & Content], [!UICONTROL Link Tracking], [!UICONTROL Referrers & Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Cookies], and [!UICONTROL Customize Page Code]).

See [FAQ - Adobe Analytics Tool](../frequently-asked-questions/faq.md#section_75E724E86D0D4952B199A9B850AE0A3E) for additional information about this tool.

## Edit an existing Adobe Analytics tool {#section_148B16AF429B4949B06238D90635B726}

You can edit an existing Adobe Analytics tool to change its configuration settings.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** icon next to an installed tool from the [!UICONTROL Overview] tab.
1. Edit the fields as desired.

   The following table includes only those elements that differ from the elements available when you are creating an Analytics tool, as described above. However, you can change any element on the page, as described in both tables.

  |Element|Description|
  |---|---|
  |Enable Automatic Configuration|This option lets Dynamic Tag Management automatically retrieve your [!DNL Adobe Analytics] account's configuration. The latest available AppMeasurement code is used and upgrade notifications are displayed for selection as new versions become available. You can also roll back to previous AppMeasurement versions as necessary, such as for compatibility reasons. Up to five previous versions are displayed. Enabling this setting changes a manually configured implementation to the automatic configuration method described in Configuration Method. |
  |Update Credentials|Refresh the API, for example, to update report suites associated with a user.|

1. (Conditional) Configure the tool further as necessary by following the directions in the sections below ( [!UICONTROL General], [!UICONTROL Library Management], [!UICONTROL Global Variables], [!UICONTROL Pageviews & Content], [!UICONTROL Link Tracking], [!UICONTROL Referrers & Campaigns], [!UICONTROL Cookies], and [!UICONTROL Customize Page Code]).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.

## Enabling Adobe Analytics Premium {#section_AEAA44566B5A46D2922E17A11D7EA217}

If you are an [!DNL Adobe Analytics Premium] customer, Dynamic Tag Management lets you take advantage of advanced features and additional eVars and events.

The following table displays the number of eVars and events available in each [!DNL Analytics] account type:

|   | [!DNL Adobe Analytics (Point Product)]  | [!DNL Adobe Analytics] (Standard)  | [!DNL Adobe Analytics Premium]  |
|---|---|---|---|
|  **eVars** | 75  | 100  | 250  |
|  **Events** | 100  | 1,000  | 1,000  |

You add the [!DNL Adobe Analytics Premium] tool using Dynamic Tag Management the same way you add [!DNL Adobe Analytics] (Standard). In order to get the [!DNL Analytics Premium] functionality (if applicable), you must do the following:

* Use the [!UICONTROL Automatic] configuration method (explained above).
* Use the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] or [!UICONTROL Web Services] authentication method (explained above).

There is no "switch" to enable [!UICONTROL Analytics Premium] functionality. Verification is done behind the scenes by API checks via the automatic configuration. The additional eVars are added to the UI if the account is authenticated as an [!UICONTROL Analytics Premium] customer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you downgrade to standard [!UICONTROL Analytics] in the future, the added premium eVars that are out of the standard range will be grayed out in both tools/rules. You can view any configured variables that are now out of range and make any necessary changes to an in-range variable. You cannot add or edit any of these out-of-range variables, but you will be able to view them and delete them.

*[!UICONTROL  Property]* > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL General]**

* Enable EU compliance for [!DNL Adobe Analytics]  Enables or disables tracking based on the EU privacy cookie.

  When a page is loaded, the system checks to see if a cookie called [!DNL sat_track] is set (or the custom cookie name specified on the [!UICONTROL Edit Property] page). Consider the following information:

    * If the cookie does not exist or if the cookie exists and is set to anything but *`true`*, the loading of the tool is skipped when this setting is enabled. Meaning, any portion of a rule that uses the tool will not apply.

      If a rule has analytics with EU compliance on and third-party code, and the cookie is set to *`false`*, the third-party code still runs. However, the analytics variables will not be set.

    * If the cookie exists but it is set to *`true`*, the tool loads normally.

  You are responsible for setting the [!DNL sat_track] (or custom named) cookie to *`false`* if a visitor opts out. You can accomplish this using custom code:

  ```
  _satellite.setCookie(“sat_track”, “false”);
  ```

  You must also have a mechanism to set that cookie to *`true`* if you want a visitor to be able to opt in later:

  ```
  _satellite.setCookie(“sat_track”, “true");
  ```

* Character Set

  Displays the available character encoding sets.
* Currency Code

  Displays the supported currency codes for selection.
* Tracking Server

  The domain at which the image request and cookie is written.

  See [trackingServer](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackingserver.html).

* SSL Tracking Server

  The domain at which the image request and cookie is written. Used for secure pages. If not defined, SSL data goes to *`trackingServer`*.

  See [trackingServerSecure](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackingserversecure.html).

* Data Center

  The Adobe data center used for data collection.

## Library management {#concept_24654766343B4E82A9416A112D2125FE}

Descriptions of the fields and options in the Library Management settings in Dynamic Tag Management.

<!--

library_management.xml

 -->

*[!UICONTROL  Property]* > **[!UICONTROL Settings Edit Tool]** > **[!UICONTROL Library Management]**

>[!NOTE]
>
>If more than one Adobe Analytics tool is used in a single web property, each tool must have a unique tracker variable name. Duplicative object variable names between Adobe Analytics tools within a single web property will cause conflicts.

* Page code is already present

  Prevents Dynamic Tag Management from installing [!DNL Adobe Analytics] page code if the code is already present on your site.

  This feature allows you to use Dynamic Tag Management to add to your existing implementation rather than starting from scratch. Be sure to properly set your tracker variable name when checking this box.

* Load library at < *`Page Top`* or *`Page Bottom`*>

  Specifies where and when to load the page code. Regardless of your selection, any rules using the Analytics tool will need to have the same setting.

* Managed by Adobe (Recommended)

  Enable Dynamic Tag Management to manage your library.

  If you select this option, the following option becomes available:

  **Library Version:** Select the latest version from the [!UICONTROL Library Version] menu. Dynamic Tag Management notifies you when new versions are available. You can revert to a previous version as necessary.

* Custom

  You can configure the library code.

  If you select this option, the following options become available:

  **Set report suites using custom code below:** When this box is checked, Dynamic Tag Management looks for a variable in your custom code called *`s_account`*. This variable should contain a comma-separated list of the report suites to which you want to send data.

  **Code Hosted:** Choose an option to host the [!DNL s_code]:

    * **In DTM**: You can host the [!DNL s_code] within Dynamic Tag Management. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit Code]** to cut and paste the file directly into the editor.

    * **URL**: If you have a good [!DNL s_code] file and are happy with the process of updating it, you can provide the URL to the file here. Dynamic Tag Management then consumes that [!DNL s_code] file for its implementation of [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

  **Open Editor:** Lets you [insert core AppMeasurement code](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#task_068D72664B2743359A64ADB8692D3658). This code is populated automatically when using the automatic configuration method described in [Adobe Analytics Settings](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#concept_FBA6679A0B79490F8296437F11E5E4F8).

  **Tracker Variable Name:** If you want to run two instances of [!DNL Adobe Analytics] in parallel (one within Dynamic Tag Management and one natively), you can rename the main *`s`* object. Renaming the object name avoids collisions.

## Insert core AppMeasurement code {#section_E497974E41454C979A8C90A84E2FE537}

<!--

t_appmeasurement_code.xml

 -->

Insert AppMeasurement code when manually deploying Dynamic Tag Management in Adobe Analytics.

1. On the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool page, expand the **[!UICONTROL General]** section, then click **[!UICONTROL Open Editor]**.

1. Unzip the [!DNL AppMeasurement_JavaScript*.zip] file you downloaded in [deploy Adobe Analytics](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#steps_B11DB32553794813ADEF9F515CC6C108).

   If you opt for custom library, when you open the window it will already have the most recent code version present. There is no need to download the zip from the Admin Console.

1. Open [!DNL AppMeasurement.js] in a text editor.
1. Copy and paste the contents into the **[!UICONTROL Edit Code]** window.

   ![](assets/edit-code.png){width="472px"}

1. Adobe recommends adding the following code above the *`Do Not Alter Anything Below This Line`*:

   ```
   var s_account="INSERT-RSID-HERE"
   var s=s_gi(s_account)

   ```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >If you add this code, it is recommended that you also select the **[!UICONTROL Set report suites using custom code below]** checkbox in the overall library settings.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save and Close]**.

   If you are using the Media Module, Integrate Module, or implementation plug-ins, you can copy them into the code section as well. The managed code in dynamic tag manager can be configured exactly like the JavaScript file in a typical implementation.

## Global variables {#concept_080C1319773943FD82A718F42093F6BB}

Field descriptions and information about variables when using Dynamic Tag Management to deploy [!DNL Adobe Analytics].

<!--

global_variables.xml

 -->

These variables fire on all page load rule beacons. You can accomplish the same effect by using a [Page-Load rule](../managing-resources/rules.md#concept_811F4216145A4E3A91190DFFC9C2D223) set to fire on all pages. These variables might not fire in [Direct Call](../managing-resources/rules.md#concept_2D3F296DD3BD418BAB7A0E2415DD9C92) and [Event-Based](../managing-resources/rules.md#concept_649E7BB6A7B3442C8F32F657BED77D54) rules.

*[!UICONTROL  Property]* > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** icon > **[!UICONTROL Edit Tool]** > **[!UICONTROL Link Tracking]**

* Enable ClickMap

  Determines whether visitor click map data is gathered.

  See [trackInlineStats](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackinlinestats.html).

* Track download links

  Tracks links to downloadable files on your site.

  See [trackDownLoadLinks](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackdownloadlinks.html).

* Download Extensions

  If your site contains links to files with any of the listed extensions, the URLs of these links will appear in reporting.

  See [linkDownloadFileTypes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/linkdownloadfiletypes.html).

* Track outbound links

  Determines whether any link clicked is an exit link.

  See [trackExternalLinks](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackexternallinks.html).

  **Single-Page App Considerations:** Because of the way some SPA websites are coded, an internal link to a page on the SPA site might look like it is an outbound link.

  You can use one of the following methods to track outbound links from SPA sites:

    * If you do not want to track any outbound links from your SPA, insert an entry into the [!UICONTROL Never Track] section.

      For example, [!DNL `https://testsite.com/spa/#`]

      All # links to this host are ignored. All outbound links to other hosts are tracked, such as [!DNL `https://www.google.com`].

    * If there are some links that you want to track on your SPA, use the [!UICONTROL Always Track] section.

      For example, if you have a [!DNL spa/#/about] page, you could put "about" in the [!UICONTROL Always Track] section.

      The "about" page is the only outbound link that is tracked. Any other links on the page (for example, [!DNL `https://www.google.com`]) are not tracked.

  Note that these two options are mutually exclusive.

* Keep URL Parameters

  Preserves query strings.

  See [linkLeaveQueryString](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/linkleavequerystring.html).

|Referrer Override|Overrides the value set in the *s.referrer* variable, which is typically populated by the referrer set in the browser.|
|Campaign|A variable that identifies marketing campaigns used to bring visitors to your site. The value of campaign is usually taken from a query string parameter.|

Use the DTM interface to choose whether you want to use a Query String or Value (which could pull from a data element):

![](assets/dtm-queryparam.png)

You can either enter your query string directly in the interface, or you can reference a separate data element if you have other means of tracking a campaign.

|Visitor Namespace|Variable to identify the domain with which cookies are set.|
|Domain Periods|The domain on which the Analytics cookie `s_cc` and `s_sq` are set by determining the number of periods in the domain of the page URL. This variable is also used by some plug-ins in determining the correct domain to set the plug-in's cookie. |
|FP Domain Periods|The `fpCookieDomainPeriods` variable is for cookies set by JavaScript (`s_sq`, `s_cc` plug-ins) that are inherently first-party cookies, even if your implementation uses the third-party `2o7.net` or `omtrdc.net` domains.|
|Transaction ID|Unique value that represents an online transaction that resulted in offline activity.|
|Cookie Lifetime|Determines the life span of a cookie.|

## Customize page code {#concept_7D6390823DFE4D29AF9505CCE1A79C3B}

Use field descriptions in Dynamic Tag Management to customize page code when deploying [!DNL Analytics].

<!--

### New features {#section_C36DF90DD3814A6E971E173B8B5A73A9}

<!--

<p> August 7: Experience Cloud ID Service deployment can be complicated from a sequencing standpoint. The new DTM feature makes sure the VisitorAPI is deployed in the correct sequence, based on the other Adobe tools that are implemented by DTM. </p>

 -->

This release offers several key usability improvements for Adobe Analytics:

**Automatic Configuration Method**

Enables automatic synchronization of [!DNL Adobe Analytics] report suites via a [!DNL Experience Cloud] login or Web Services ID.

![](assets/add_analytics_tool.png)

### Frequently asked questions {#section_75E724E86D0D4952B199A9B850AE0A3E}

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|Is this a new [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool, or a change to the existing tool? |A change to the existing tool. If you currently have an implementation of [!DNL Adobe Analytics] in Dynamic Tag Management, it will continue to function.|
|If I make configuration changes in the new version of the tool, can I test in staging before publishing to production?|Yes. All changes can be tested in staging just like you normally would before deploying to a production environment. If you choose not to publish, because you notice issues in staging, the production code will continue to function as it did before the new integration was released.|
|If I switch from manual configuration (the default setting for existing tools) to automatic configuration, will my current settings be affected?|No.|
|If I switch from manual library management to Managed by Adobe, will my current settings or code be affected?|Any user code that you have specified is overwritten with the base [!DNL AppMeasurement] library. You must move this code to the new Custom Page Code section at the end of the tool configuration so that the code continues executing. This method allows the [!DNL AppMeasurement] library to be managed (and upgraded) separately from the user's custom code.|
|Will the revision history for the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool be retained when the new integration is released?|Yes.|

### Potential pitfalls {#section_201BF9E0EB7D4BC2B72A617543C2030B}

There is a small chance that the new integration could cause data collection issues if you currently use [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. These issues could arise only if you publish your library to production subsequent to the release. (Production code remains intact until publishing occurs.)

To avoid these issues, ensure that:

* Report suite IDs are correctly entered in the tool.
* Report suite IDs in the tool match the IDs in the [!DNL AppMeasurement] code.
* The currency code, character set, tracking server, and SSL tracking server configuration fields are correctly set with supported values.
* Custom code is defined in [!DNL Library Management].

## Manually implement Adobe Analytics (legacy) {#task_3A00639CADF14C9C844F962222077E4E}

Create an Adobe Analytics tool for deployment using Dynamic Tag Management. This procedure describes a manual (legacy) implementation.
