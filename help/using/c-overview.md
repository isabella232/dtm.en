# Dynamic Tag Management overview{#dynamic-tag-management-overview}

Dynamic Tag Management lets marketers quickly and easily manage tags and provides innovative tools for collecting and distributing data across digital marketing systems. Dynamic Tag Management also enables responsive delivery of user-specific content —providing new levels of agility and control to companies seeking to thrive in today’s fast paced digital marketplace.

## Business challenge {#section_9B6ACC3CFB5542CDAB47BC7D345DA870}

The world of digital marketing is a complex space. Marketers are expected to consistently identify their customers and prospects and the online spaces they inhabit—and that’s just the beginning. Marketers must then deliver content while measuring its engagement and effectiveness all the way through the conversion funnel and beyond. To accomplish this, marketers have historically needed to rely upon JavaScript “tags” to implement their strategies and programs on their websites. For the most part, “tagging” sites and other online experiences has been the domain of IT, subjecting marketing strategy to IT process and prolonged implementations based upon technical release schedules and resource availability.

In addition, as the technologies and tools used by marketers to implement digital strategies and deliver consumer experiences become more sophisticated, the technical requirements associated with installing and managing these tools continues to grow.

These factors are hampering marketers’ ability to quickly adapt to the fast-paced, dynamic digital marketplace and compromising the effectiveness of the very tools that are designed to make digital marketers successful.

## Solution {#section_4A8732A2A0704EFEBB3D6A7290FBB38D}

Dynamic Tag Management provides digital marketers tremendous flexibility and control to implement and optimize digital experiences while reducing IT dependence—allowing marketers to focus on marketing, rather than tags. Dynamic Tag Management not only solves standard tag management problems, such as code deployment, data management, and rule building, but also provides an intuitive capability that maps directly to marketing scenarios and user experiences. This approach makes it easier for marketers to develop digital marketing strategies and quickly implement them without dealing with potentially frustrating IT projects. To allow marketers to deliver the right message or collect the right data for any given scenario, this robust capability identifies specific users and audience segments on the site to enable instantaneous delivery of segment-specific content and to generate specific experience-based reporting.

Dynamic Tag Management is offered to Adobe Experience Cloud customers as an included, value-add feature. Adobe is committed to keeping the Dynamic Tag Management capability open and will continue to develop features that allow for deployment of the most popular digital marketing services, including non-Adobe services.
