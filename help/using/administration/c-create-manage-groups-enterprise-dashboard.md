# Create and manage groups for DTM in the Adobe Admin Console

Information to help you create new user groups in the Experience Cloud and to manage Dynamic Tag Management property access.

## Create new user groups in the Experience Cloud {#section_08040874355948F8951A15ADE6BD9DE0}

1. Log in to the Adobe Admin Console via [adminconsole.adobe.com](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Products]** > **[!UICONTROL Dynamic Tag Management]**. 
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** icon to add a new group (product configuration).

   For the group to display in the list, it must be added in the Adobe Admin Console, as explained in [Manage Web Property Access in DTM](../administration/c-create-manage-groups-enterprise-dashboard.md#section_9BDEC92A8D284D1F952192C9373D82FA).

   If a user has already been added as a user to the [!DNL Experience Cloud], that user can be added to the group by clicking into the Users tab. Adding a user creates or updates the user in DTM and assigns the user to the appropriate DTM group.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Adding an Admin allows the user to manage the group in the Experience Cloud. It does not add the user as an admin in DTM.

   For more information on user roles, see [Create and Manage Groups in DTM](../administration/groups.md#concept_6494F1EF2400457ABCED8D860951CD36).
