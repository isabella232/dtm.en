# Dynamic Tag Management Object Reference

A basic object reference for _satellite.

 The `_satellite` object is the essential dynamic tag management (DTM) JavaScript object that is generated by the DTM libraries.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To ensure ongoing success of your implementation, do not configure custom code in your library to override any of the `_satellite` object methods. Only the methods specified below are safe to call directly. Reliance on custom code using other `_satellite` object methods may put your implementation at risk, as these methods could be subject to change in future product releases.

`_satellite` object references that are safe to call directly in custom code:

```
_satellite.notify()
_satellite.track()
_satellite.getVar()
_satellite.setVar()
_satellite.getVisitorId()
_satellite.setCookie()
_satellite.readCookie()
_satellite.removeCookie()
_satellite.isLinked()

```
