# Create new rule

Steps that describe how to create rules in dynamic tag management.

1. [Create a web property](../web_property.md#task_AE34E23EC47B4E9C8634782C05D9DC09), if you haven't done so already.
1. In the web property, click the **[!UICONTROL Rules]** tab.
1. Select the type of rule you wish to create from the left navigation pane, such as Event Based Rules or Page Load Rules.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Create New Rule]**.
1. Name the rule and select a category, if you wish.
1. Next, set up the condition(s) for the rule. The setup differs depending on the type of rule you are implementing.

       |---|---|
       | **Page Load rule** | [Creating conditions for page load rules](../t_rules_create/t_rules_page_conditions.md#task_69B41CB230EE4530A755D91233F73706)  |

   The category field is only for your own organizational purposes and is not required. You can delete categories by clicking the x icon in the category. 
1. [Set up actions for the condition to trigger](../t_rules_create/t_rules_actions.md#task_94DFE0D8B53A43E2892851BABE381121).
