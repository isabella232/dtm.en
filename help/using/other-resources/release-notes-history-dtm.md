**Fixes: **

* Updated the variable and event interface for the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool to allow auto-complete selection and to enable access to additional eVars and events for [!DNL Analytics Premium] accounts. See [Add Adobe Analytics Tool](../tools-reference/analytics-dtm.md#concept_FBA6679A0B79490F8296437F11E5E4F8).  

* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL Store Path] option for FTP library deployments wasn’t updating for production libraries when using nested directories.  
* Updated data elements to support hyphenated names. 
* Fixed an issue where the column indicator in the [!UICONTROL Rules] table displayed for a rule, even if the tool was deleted.  
* Updated the [!UICONTROL Sequential HTML] code option to be available for page-load rules only. This option no longer appears for event-based rules. A notice displays with a [!UICONTROL Sequential HTML] tag on an event-based rule to notify users to change the tag before the rule can be saved.  

* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL Sign in with Adobe ID] login option wasn’t allowing users to sign in as a different user. Users can click [!UICONTROL Sign in with a Different Adobe ID] to log out as the current [!DNL Experience Cloud] user and be redirected to the Adobe login page.

* Addressed various localization issues to increase the user experience for supported languages. 
* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL Channel] field wasn’t included in rules specifying a `s.tl()` call in [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. 

* Fixed an issue where copied rules weren’t automatically added to the staging library until a change was made to the rules. 
* Fixed an issue where Regex was firing for rules using the “parameters” condition option, even if the parameter wasn’t present.

## January 13 2015 {#section_1413A743D84E4BF29C1691DD1940261D}

Fixes:

* Dynamic tag management no longer overrides global variables with the name *`window.t`*. 
* Fixed an issue where Firefox was incorrectly trapping the right-click event handler in the browser and causing click-based rules to fire.

**Fixes and Improvements**

* Fixed an issue where rule copying did not work after the release of the [!DNL Adobe Media Optimizer] integration on 10/30/2014.  
* Added the ability to specify name/value pairs for general settings and customer-specified IDs in the Experience Cloud ID tool. 
* Added option for the Experience Cloud ID tool to trigger the initial API call. This call enables support for Adobe solutions that do not currently trigger this call already in your own code. 
* Fixed an issue where the browser version tracked by dynamic tag management for certain versions of Internet Explorer was returned as *`Unknown`* instead of *`Internet Explorer`*.  

* Adobe tools will now be displayed first in the listing of installed tools on a given web property.

**Fixes and Improvements**

* Fixed an issue where the Tracking Server value automatically determined by dynamic tag management for the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool sometimes set an incorrect value.  
* Fixed an issue where a restored data element had the name appended with "(Restored)," which caused previous references to that data element to be broken. (The appended value is now added only if restoring the data element would create a naming conflict with an existing data element.) 
* Fixed an issue caused when triggering an event-based rule on a click event. If the click event had a delay link activation on an anchor tag with no HREF, the issue forced the browser to attempt to navigate to a blank HREF location. 
* Fixed an issue where dynamic tag management was no longer saving global variables configured in an Analytics tool when changes to that tool had been rejected and then restored. 
* Implemented significant performance improvements in the library generation process, which should result in a shorter wait for changes to appear in production, especially during peak usage hours. 
* Fixed an issue where company administrators were unable to export their activity log to CSV when there was a large amount of data present. 
* Added the ability to use custom HTML data attributes with CSS selector-based data elements.

## August 21 2014 {#section_82776A5125824EB89EBFFA1ADCB1808F}

Fixes and improvements:

* The help landing for dynamic tag management is now at:

  [https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/dtm/)

  Please update your bookmarks accordingly. 

* Fixed an issue where re-enabling a previously disabled property caused all approved items to be immediately published. A property will now be enabled, but published assets will not be affected until a publish request is explicitly requested by a user with appropriate permissions. 
* Fixed an issue where custom code editors in dynamic tag management were truncating the last few lines of displayed code. 
* Fixed an issue where reverting a tool to a previous version did not revert all settings for that tool. 
* Users can now force a data element's value to be automatically converted to lowercase before it is returned and used. 
* Fixed issue where a race condition in the dynamic tag management engine prevented data from being sent correctly to audience management.

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where disabling and then enabling a property caused the items in the approvals queue to be automatically published by the system when the property was re-enabled. 
* Added a message to the [!UICONTROL Embed] tab for company administrators. This message is a reminder that no code is published to the production environment until someone explicitly clicks **[!UICONTROL Publish]**. This fix was done to help avoid confusion by some users who were seeing *`404 Not Found`* errors on the production library, because they had not yet published. 

* Fixed an issue where duplicate registrations were possible for the same user using a differing case. (For example, [!DNL user@DOMAIN.com] vs [!DNL user@domain.com]). 

* Fixed an [!DNL Adobe Analytics] issue that prevented you from re-adding or editing an *`eVar`* or *`prop`* value after deleting that specific variable or property. 

* Fixed an issue where rejecting an approved or published tool, and then updating that tool, did not cause a new entry to be generated in the approvals queue. 
* Fixed an issue where the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool configuration options for *`Always Track`* and *`Never Track`* did not emit the correct values to the library and therefore did not have any effect on data collection. 

* Fixed an issue where entering invalid regular expressions caused a broken interface and required you to reload the page. 
* Google Analytics event tag: Fixed an issue where a *`Fill in all fields`* error appeared on a rule, but you were unable to save the rule or make any additional edits and was required to reload the page.

## May 15 2014 {#section_AD67AC3BCE334DF9A7624EE7F97BDE98}

Fixes and improvements for May 15, 2014:

* Fixed an issue where variables set in custom code were not being set on direct call or event-based rules using [!DNL s.t()]. The code contained within the custom code area for direct call or event-based rules using [!DNL s.t()] was not correctly adding any variables set to the beacon before an image request was being fired. 

* Fixed and issue where the command bar was sticking to the bottom of the [!UICONTROL Approvals] page. The persistent bar with the Edit and Reject commands on the [!UICONTROL Approvals] page was sticking to the bottom of the page rather than following the page view upon scroll. 

* Fixed an issue on the [!UICONTROL Rule List] page, where a newly created rule showed [!DNL Adobe Analytics] in use, even if those rules were not using [!DNL Adobe Analytics]. 

* Fixed layout issues on [!UICONTROL Selective Publish] queue page. We cleaned up the layout so that it is not truncated or stretching beyond the boundary of the content area of the page. 
* Data elements now display in alphabetical order in the Data Element Value criteria of a rule. They have now been alphabetized for easier viewing. 
* The items on the publish history are now paginated to improve performance and user experience. 
* Added password security enhancements. To ensure the security for dynamic tag management accounts, we have implemented a number of enhancements to our authentication system:

    * New passwords must meet specific criteria (minimum 7 characters, at least one number, at least one letter, at least one symbol, not one of the last 5 passwords). 
    * Company admins can now see how long it has been since a user last changed their password. 
    * Company admins can now force users to reset their password. 
    * Users attempting to log in 5 times unsuccessfully will be locked out for 30 minutes to prevent brute force attacks (the user or their company admin can reset the password to re-enable access immediately).

## May 8 2014 {#section_8F8F5385C7B549F59F78CCFB2443237E}

Fixes for May 8, 2014:

* Fixed an issue where *`trackingServer`* value was not being applied consistently. The value for *`s.TrackingServer`* should be used consistently for all types of calls throughout dynamic tag management, and the value should be pulled either from the custom code or from the UI, depending on the configuration of a specific web property. (The UI value takes precedence if set in both locations.) 

* Fixed an issue where properties with a large number of items awaiting approval was causing 500 errors and timeouts. We optimized the queries for the approvals workflow to ensure that properties with a large number of items awaiting approval would load quickly and not result in timeouts, errors, or broken pages. 
* Fixed an issue where pages with an existing object called 's' would cause errors in dynamic tag management. Dynamic tag management tries to initialize an 's' object on the page for [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tracking, and this was causing a conflict if [!DNL Analytics] was implemented via dynamic tag management and the *`Page code already exists`* box was not checked. The object is now locally scoped within dynamic tag management, so it will work in any custom code scenarios but will not conflict with any on-page code. 

* We made a number of improvements to the way that hierarchies are managed in [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tools and rules, including ensuring that non-sequential hierarchies could be used together in a tool or rule, and ensuring that the same hierarchy could not be set more than once in a tool or rule.

## April 28 2014 {#section_72C1A347664C43C8A30C4B8AACA400B7}

Fixes for April 28, 2014

* Fixed an issue where direct call and event-based rules that were configured to send a page view (using [!DNL s.t()]) were not executing custom code.

## April 17 2014 {#section_7D43ABB68A4343229D22AFA1FC4DC1FE}

Fixes for April 17, 2014

* Fixed an issue in which an error displayed when you delete data elements that were associated with rules that had already been deleted. 
* Fixed an issue in which deleted data elements were still shown in the menu when you add a condition to a rule based on a data element. 
* Fixed an issue where fields and values for Google Universal Analytics rules were showing as *`modified`* in the Approval view, even if the rules had not been changed. This issue also occurred on new rules. 
* Fixed an issue where the Google Universal Analytics tool configuration allowed you to configure the cookie timeout in milliseconds, even though Google Universal Analytics does not support this. 
* Changed *`AdLens`* to *`Media Optimizer`*. 

* Users can now use the % syntax to view the pop-up list of data elements when sending values to [!DNL Media Optimizer]. 
* Modified styling on tool lists to better accommodate tools with long names, and to improve readability.

## April 8 2014 {#section_C66A861824D748468B1E232F419DE3A4}

Fixes for April 8, 2014

* Fixed the styling on the [!UICONTROL Forgot Password] page to improve appearance. 
* Fixed an issue where approved/published rule conditions were being removed from production library upon deletion in staging. 
* Fixed an issue where the [!UICONTROL Actions] menu on the [!UICONTROL Rule List] page was being cut off at the bottom, if there were less than three rules being displayed. 

* Fixed alignment for the Create Data Element button on the [!UICONTROL Data Elements] page. 
* Fixed alignment for the Create New Schedule button on the [!UICONTROL Scheduling] page. 
* Fixed an issue where long rule names were breaking the [!UICONTROL Selective Publish] page. 
* Fixed an issue where deleting [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics] variable values would, in certain cases, result in a broken UI that required a page refresh to fix.

Fixes for April 3, 2014:

* Fixed an issue where clicks were not being tracked in certain scenarios when the **[!UICONTROL Page code is already present]** box was enabled in the [!DNL Adobe Analytics] tool configuration. 

* Fixed an issue where all approvables were being deployed in staging, rather than just the ones that were added or modified. This issue potentially resulted in delays to seeing staging updates. 
* Fixed an issue where *`linkTrackVars`* and *`linkTrackEvents`* were being overwritten by rules, rather than appending to existing values (such as those set in [!DNL s_code]). 

* Fixed an issue where use of special characters (such as brackets) in data element names caused exceptions when you edited the data element. 
* Fixed an issue where a lengthy shared secret for library download bundles caused exceptions (showed as a 500 Server Error). 
* Fixed an issue where the *`cookieLifetime`* variable was being emitted to the library with incorrect capitalization, causing the corresponding setting from the interface to be disregarded when the page was loaded.

## March 11 2014 {#section_23FFF5B7457E4D16B68FCB2FAD803972}

Fixes for the March 11, 2014 release:

* Fixed issue where test files ( [!DNL ftp_test.txt]) were being left on FTP/SFTP servers after upload was complete. This file is now deleted once the upload is complete as it is only used to test the ability to validate user credentials and is not actually needed by dynamic tag management. 
* Fixed issue where custom port for FTP/SFTP was not being saved.

**Fixes**

* Fixed issue with SVG images in older IE browsers. SVG images that were clicked in older IE browsers (prior to IE version 9) caused errors and would sometimes cause the browser to crash. 
* Fixed issue with custom links in direct call rules. Using custom links in direct call rules would generate a JavaScript error in the browser. 
* Fixed issue with data element rule conditions referencing the wrong name. If a user renamed a data element, and the data element was being referenced in a rule condition, the rule would try to use the most recently specified name for that data element. This issue occurred even if the name change had not yet been published. 
* Fixed issue where elements without an HREF attribute caused errors when clicked. This issue is regarding the "linker link" functionality in the dynamic tag management engine, which attempts to automatically track any clicked elements on the page. Elements without an HREF were generating errors. The "linker link" code now checks that the element is an anchor tag before attempting to track clicks on it.

The following table provides information about release notes and fixes for this release. 

|  Fixed Issue  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Interaction required to save a rule.  | A user must click in a field or make a change to a rule before the Save button is activated. Otherwise, to leave a rule without making changes, you must click Cancel.  |
|  Errant text appearing on selective publish UI in Firefox.  | Fixed an issue where text was being displayed (when it shouldn't have been) at the end of each row in the selective publish UI in Firefox only.  |
|  Buttons for approval modal are not centered.  | Centered the Yes/No buttons in the approval confirmation modal window.  |
|  Sidebar collapse icon not appearing correctly in Firefox.  | The icon that appears to the left of the breadcrumbs allowing a user to collapse/expand their sidebar was not displaying correctly in Firefox. It should now be displaying correctly.  |
|  Company admin can see who invited a user.  | Administrators can now see the name of the person who invited a particular user to their company (if the person who invited the user is an Adobe employee, the admin will simply see *`DTM Admin`* in place of the name).  |
|  Adding Target arguments breaks rule formatting.  | Fixed an issue where a user adding arguments to a rule containing an [!DNL Adobe Target] tool would see an incorrectly formatted/broken UI  |
